### Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. The project is open source on the Github platform, so everyone has the possibility to suggest changes. Every effort is made to prevent any risk as far as possible in terms of quality and safety. This risk should be further reduced by the mutual monitoring of the code on the platform. We assume no liability for damages caused by third party software (such as the Electron Framework) or if the cause of the damage does not lie in the source code or the developers of the program, but through their own fault, such as computer viruses or malicious programs that exploit the security holes of the above software.

You assume all necessary maintenance, repairs or corrections in the event of damage resulting from this.
