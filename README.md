### What is Filely?

Filely is a next-generation file transfer client with an integrated terminal.
It combines a modern design and efficiency while you are working on your projects.
You can use different protocols like SFTP, FTP and FTPS, as well as SSH for terminal connections.

That are the features that make our software special:

* **Integrated shell**

  While you are uploading your files you can dock a terminal to one side and run commands in it

* **Eye-friendly dark mode**

  Light designs can be very exhausting especially when you are in a dark environment.
  One simple setting eliminates this problem by changing to a calm dark theme.

* **Editor inside**

  Quickly modify files within the app with one click and the integrated text editor with syntax highlighting.

* **Security counts**

  Besides the traditional login methods like passwords or SSH keys, there is the possibility to use U2F-enabled devices like a YubiKey.

* **Integrated VNC client**

  Use VNC to use the desktop environment of your server or restore your server after a forgotten password.

* **No monthly costs**

  You only pay a small amount once.
